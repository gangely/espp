# Publish DHT
:TOC:

## info
* this set of scripts will publish DHT22 temperature and humidity measurements to subscribed MQTT clients, as long as battery or 5VDC measurement, and status messages
* the MQTT topics are: `esp32/battery`, `esp32/dht`, `esp32/status`
* this page describes a short HOWTO to set up and run the scripts
* more notes can be found on the Wiki:

## software installation 
NOTE: 20180419 notes common to all subprojects will be moved to link:https://github.com/gangely/espp/wiki/MQTT-common-installation[MQTT common installation] page

### on the ESP32
prerequisite: have MicroPython installed and accessed through REPL

#### MQTT libraries
see the wiki page: link:https://github.com/gangely/espp/wiki/MicroPython-uMQTT[install the MicroPython MQTT libraries]

* `mqtt.simple`
* `mqtt.robust`

note: `dht_pub.py` is written with import from `mqtt.robust`, but `mqtt.simple` is ok

#### uPython scripts 
copy the files:

* `../boot/boot.py`
* `../boot/mycredentials.py`
* `../common/setrtc.py`
* `main.py`
* `dht_pub.py`

#### parameters to edit

* `boot.py`: `STAADDR` `STAMASK` `STAGW` `STADNS`
* `mycredentials.py`: `MYAPSSID` `MYAPPASS`
* `dht_pub.py`: `BROKER`

### on the broker

#### Mosquitto
* follow the wiki page: link:https://github.com/gangely/espp/wiki/Mosquitto[install and start Mosquitto]

### on the workstation

#### Python and Paho MQTT
* prerequisite: have Python 2.7.9+ or Python 3.4+ installed
* follow the wiki page: link:https://github.com/gangely/espp/wiki/Paho-MQTT[install Paho MQTT client]

#### Python scripts
copy the files:

* `bat_print.py`  `dht_print.py`  `sta_print.py`
* `bat_log.py`  `dht_log.py`  `sta_log.py`  [TODO: log to be reworked]
* `topic_print.py`

#### parameter to edit
* in `topic_print.py`, edit `BROKER`; address format can be `<hostname>` or `<111.222.333.444>`

## scripts usage

### on the ESP32

* in REPL: `import dht_pub`
* to change the deepsleep length, adjust `SLEEPTIME`; the value is in _minutes_
* to monitor: the `esperr.log` file; TODO: rewrite log to split in day-by-day files

### on client workstation

#### printing on terminals
* open up to 3 terminals, one for each topic, and launch the requested MQTT client: +
----
python

>>> import dht_print # or bat_print or sta_print
----
* example with `tmux`: ESP32 REPL in upper half; 3 MQTT clients in lower half +

#### logging to files
* the `bat/dht/sta_log.py` scripts are usable; printing is the same than with `*_print.py`, and the messages will be appended to topic log files `espbat.log` `espdht.log` and `espsta.log`; TODO: rewrite log to split in day-by-day files
